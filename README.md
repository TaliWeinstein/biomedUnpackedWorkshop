# Biomedical Unpacked Workshop 

## Overview 
As part of the [Biomedical Unpacked Workshop](https://www.womeng.org/events/biomedical-engineering-unpacked-workshop) I designed and ran on the 14th of August 2022, there was a hands-on coding learning project completed with an Adafruit Board and the arduino IDE. The end goal of the activity was to monitor a person's photoplethysmography (ppg) signal coming from their finger.

## File Overview
This activity was broken up into stages to ensure participants were able to:

1. Switch on and get the light source working via the **BlinkingLights.io** file
2. Enable the participants to get the light sensor configured via the **LightSensor.io** file
3. Put everything together to monitor their (ppg) graphically via the**PulseWaves.io** file

Each file has its corresponding solutions whereby the code has been completed according to the exercises in the **Solution Development Pack.pdf**. The **VolenteerPack.pdf** consists of the information provided to the volenteers in the workshop who were assisting participants.
